# Serverless Airline Reservation
I have this crazy idea! I am going to build a production quality Serverless Airline Reservation application 
using nothing but AWS SDK and CLI. But here is the kicker: When I repeat an activity, I will write a shell script 
for it. Next time I repeat the activity again, I will convert the script to a Python tool.

I don't know if I will complete the application, but I hope to create a collection of minimal tools necessary to build
a production quality serverless app.

I will be documenting the everything I do in journal style, so others can follow along in their own pace. Read the 
[COMMENTARY](COMMENTARY.md) file to follow along.
